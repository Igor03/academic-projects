# Academic Projects
Here you have some (the ones I was able to find going through my stuff) of the projects/algorithms that I developed during my CS degree. In this repository we have a bunch projects the were built with a number o languages including
C, Java, MATLAB, Python. Inside some of those projects you may find a .pdf file that is, usually, a report containing results and, most of those reports were build using LaTeX.

# Important Informations

Some of those projects are little bit messy, after all, the projects that compose this codebase were built a long time ago, when I was just learning code (not that I an expert today hahaha). Another thing, all of the reports are written in portuguese (ot-BR). If you are having a hard time trying to understand or run any given project, just send me an email and I will try to help you out the best way I can.
